## About me
I am 34 years old. I work as a bartender, but I want to change my profession and that's why I'm taking JavaScript/Front-end courses. This is very interesting for me and I hope that soon I will master this profession and be able to work in it.
## Code examples
Complete the solution so that it returns true if the first argument(string) passed in ends with the 2nd argument (also a string).

```
function solution(str, ending){
     return str.slice(str.length - ending.length, str.length) === ending;
}
```
